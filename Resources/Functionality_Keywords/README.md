# Functionality_Keywords (FK)
First (mandatory) level of Scalable Test Automation Framework. 
On this level we should deliver method from Libs or other keywords from FK level.
We can zip keywords from Lib to bigger block.
All created keywords need to be Product independent (naming, values, flows etc).
